**1. How much is the current memory capacity of a canister?**
   
Wasm heap memory limit is 4GiB
Stable memory limit is 48GiB
Source: Todo find source and link to it.

**2. What is the issue with the following code sample?**
```
actor {
  let counter : Nat = 0;
  public func increment_counter() : async () {
    counter := counter + 1;
  };
}
```
Cannot change value of variable declared with `let`
Should declare counter with `var` for mutability.

**3. What is the issue with the following code sample?**
```
actor {
  var message : Text = 0;

  public query func change_message(new_message : Text) : async () {
    message := new_message;
    return;
  };
  
  public query func see_message() : async Text {
    return(message);
  };
}
```

The `message` variable type is Text but is assigned a number.

**4.  False or True: we can remove the keyword **async** for the return argument of a query function since queries are faster to answer.**

True
